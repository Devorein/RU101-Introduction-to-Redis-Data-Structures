      What is the output of line 2

      ```shell
      bitfield bfd set u1 6 1
      get bfd
      ```
    answers:
      text: 0
      explanation: The value 1 is stored in the sixth index of the bitfield, thus `00000010 = 2`
    options:
      - "`\\x02`"
      - "`\\x03`"
      - "`\\x04`"
      - "`\\x00`"

      What is the output of line 4

      ```shell
      bitfield b1 set u1 6 1
      bitfield b2 set u1 7 1
      bitop or b3 b1 b2
      get b3
      ```
    answers:
      text: 0
      explanation: After the `OR` operation, b3 becomes `00000011 = 3`
    options:
      - "`\\x03`"
      - "`\\x02`"
      - "`\\x04`"
      - "`\\x00`"

      ```
    answers:
      text: 2
      explanation: After the `OR` operation, b3 becomes `00000011`, thus 2 bits are set
  - question: Which of the following operations are provided by the `bitop` command
    answers:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
      - 3
    options:
      - OR
      - AND
      - XOR
      - NOT
      - NOR
      - XNOR
  - question: What sort of offset does the `bitcount` command use ?
    answers: 0
    options:
      - byte
      - bit

      What is the output of line 2

      ```shell
      bitfield b set u1 7 1 set u1 15 1 set u1 23 1
      bitcount b 1 2
      ```
    answers:

      explanation: b stores the value `00000001 00000001 00000001`, since the start index is a byte offset, it starts at 8 and ends at 23, within that range 2 bits are set.
  - question: Get the bit number of the first `1` stored in bitfield `b`
    answers: bitpos b 1
