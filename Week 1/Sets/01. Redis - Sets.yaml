        explanation: |
          Redis does not store empty lists, sets, sorted sets or hashes. Therefore, the key is removed if this condition is met.
          In this example, when SPOP command is executed, then the set is empty. Redis at this point removes the key.
          When the EXISTS command is executed, the value of zero is returned, because the key no longer exists.
