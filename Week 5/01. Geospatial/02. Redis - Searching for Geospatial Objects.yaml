  - question: Get the distance between the `p1` and `p2` point of `geo1` in mile
    answers:
      - - geodist geo1 p1 p2 mi
        - geodist geo1 p2 p1 mi
  - question: Get the points of `geo1` located within 30 km radius from the lat `1` and long `2e`
    answers: georadius geo1 2 1 30 km
  - question: Get the points and the distance of `geo1` located within 30 km radius from the lat `1` and long `2`
    answers: georadius geo1 2 1 30 km withdist
  - question: |
      Get the point within `geo1` 

      1. furthest away from the coordinate lat `1` and long `2`
      2. located within `30` km radius
      3. With distance

    answers:
      text: georadius geo1 2 1 30 km count 1 desc withdist
      explanation: Desc sorts the result in descending order, and count 1 limits to return only 1 result
