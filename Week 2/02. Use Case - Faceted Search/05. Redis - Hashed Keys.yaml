  - question:
      - In order to create a compound index in redis, its required to create a consistent
      - of the
      - thats needed to be searched for
    answers:
      - hash
      - attributes
  - question: Should the hashed value need to be reproducible based on same input ?

      explanation: |
        Since hashed key set's hashed key is generated based on a hashing algorithm, the key can be quite complex.

        Thus most of the time its automated.

        As a result when the set has to be retrieved, the hashed value needs to be reproduced again for the same input.
    options:
      - Yes
      - No
  - question: Can any hashing algorithm be used to generate the key ?
    answers: 0
    options:
      - Yes
      - No
  - question: Which of the following set commands are used for hashed keys search ?
    answers:
      - text: 0
        explanation: "`sadd` is used to add members to the hashed key set"
      - text: 1
        explanation: "`srange` is used to get all the members of the hashed key set"
    options:
      - "`sadd`"
      - "`srange`"
      - "`sinter`"
      - "`scard`"
  - question: What are the drawbacks of hashed key searching ?
    answers: 0
    options:
      - If the attribute x value combinations changes
      - If the number of attribute of the data changes
      - If the number of value of the data changes
  - question: Which scenario is best for hashed key searching ?
    answers: 0
    options:
      - If the data doesn't change much
      - If the number of attributes is more
      - If the data distribution is more
  - question: Using the hashed faceting method, what is the limiting factor?
    answers:
      text: 0
      explanation: |
        The hashed faceting method will result in a Set which contains keys for each matching object with the attribute values being searched for.

        The limiting factor is therefore the cardinality of the set for any given attribute x value combination.
    options:
      - The number of matches for any given attribute combination
      - The number of keys that have to be matched and inspected
      - The number of attributes that have to be matched
