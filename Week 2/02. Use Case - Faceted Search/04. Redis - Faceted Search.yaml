questions:
  - question: What data structure is used for faceted search ?
    answers: 0
    options:
      - sets
      - sorted sets
      - lists
      - hash
  - question: In a faceted search all the combinations of the attributes and its values are stored in a set ?
    answers: 0
    options:
      - Yes
      - No
  - question: Which set operation is used to find the search result ?
    answers: sinter
  - question: Time complexity of `sinter` command depends on which factors ?
    answers:
      - 0
      - 1
      - 2
    options:
      - Cardinality of the smallest set
      - Number of sets
      - Members of the set
  - question: If there are three sets A, B and C, with cardinality of 2, 5 and 1 respectively, whose cardinality will the result of faceted search depend upon ?
    answers:
      text: C
      explanation: Since the cardinality of set C is the lowest, the search result of the faceted search will depend upon the only member of set C
  - question: |
      A set has 2 members  
      B set has 5 members  
      C set has 1 member

      Write the most efficient way for faceted search
    answers:
      text: sinter C A B
      explanation: Since C has the lowest cardinality, searching its only member in the other sets is gonna be a lot more efficient
  - question:
      - Cardinality for a
      - search set is governed by the data
      - of the
      - for that
      - .
    answers:
      - faceted
      - distribution
      - values
      - attribute
    difficulty: Advanced
  - question: Is it required to gain insight regarding the data distribution for efficient faceted search ?
    answers:
      text: 0
      explanation: Since data distribution dictates the cardinality of the faceted search sets, and time complexity of it depends on the cardinality of the sets.
    options:
      - Yes
      - No
  - question: What is the equation of the Time Complexity of a faceted search ?
    answers: 0
    options:
      - Cardinality of smallest set * Number of sets
      - Cardinality of highest set * Number of sets
      - Cardinality of highest set
      - Cardinality of smallest set
  - question: Using the faceting method with Sets, what is the limiting factor?
    answers:
      - text: 0
        explanation: If the data values are too varied then a lot of sets has to be created for the same attributes, or if the data values are too similar then the cardinality of the sets will increase.
      - text: 1
        explanation: If there are multiple attributes to be checked for, then similarly a lot of sets has to be created
    options:
      - The data distribution of the attribute values being matched
      - The number of attributes that have to be matched
      - Number of keys that have to be matched and inspected
