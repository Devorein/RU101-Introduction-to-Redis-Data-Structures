  - question: Find the union between sorted sets `z1` and `z2` and store in `z3`, with the `max` aggregate
    answers: zunionstore z3 2 z1 z2 aggregate max
  - question: Find the union between set `s1` and sorted set `z1`, by using weight `1.5` for `s1` and `1` for `z1`, storing in `z2`, using the aggregate sum
    answers: zunionstore z2 2 s1 z1 weights 1.5 1 aggregate sum

      What will be the output of line 4
      ```shell
      sadd s1 a b c
      zadd z1 1 a 2 b 3 c
      zunionstore z2 2 s1 z1 weights 0.5 1 aggregate sum
      zscore z2 a
      ```
    answers:
      text: 1.5
      explanation: Weight of member a from `s1` is `0.5` and weight of it from `z1` is `1`. Since the aggregate is `sum`, `0.5 + 1 = 1.5`

      ```shell
      sadd s1 a b c
      zadd z1 1 a 2 b 3 c
      zunionstore z2 2 s1 z1 weights 3 4 aggregate max
      zscore z2 a
      ```
    answers:
      text: 4
      explanation: Weight of member a from `s1` is `3` and weight of it from `z1` is `4 * 1 = 4`. Since the aggregate is `max`, `4 > 3`
